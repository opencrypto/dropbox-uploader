# **Dropbox-uploader**

**System Control Script for uploading to Dropbox the** contents of a specific directory

## **Installation**

**To begin, update the **`.dropbox_uploader`** file by opening it in a text editor and replacing** the placeholder values with your actual Dropbox s**ecrets. For instance:**

```bash
$ nano .dropbox_uploader
```

Once you have updated that file, copy it to the [root](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/massi/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) userâ€™s home directory:

```bash
$ cp .dropbox_uploader /root/.dropbox_uploader
```

Next, copy the entire [bin](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/massi/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) directory to `/root/bin`. This directory contains the script that automates the file uploads:

```bash
$ cp -r bin/ /root/bin
```

Within the newly copied [dropbox_uploader.sh](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/massi/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) file, locate and change the name of the target directory to the one you want to monitor. You can do this by editing the file:

```bash
$ nano /root/bin/dropbox_uploader.sh
```

### Installing the Script as a Service

After editing, copy the [dropbox-uploader.service](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/massi/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) file to the [system](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/massi/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) directory. This step registers the new service with your system:

```bash
$ cp systemd/dropbox-uploader.service \
      /etc/systemd/system/dropbox-uploader.service
```

Once copied, reload the systemd manager configuration so it recognizes the new service:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
```

You are now ready to enable automatic startup of the service and to start it immediately:

```bash
$ systemctl enable dropbox-uploader &&
      systemctl start dropbox-uploader
```

### Enjoy Automated Uploads

At this point, you have successfully installed and started the application. To enjoy automated uploads, simply copy or move files into the target directory you specified in `dropbox_uploader.sh`. 

The service will automatically handle the uploading process to your Dropbox account.
